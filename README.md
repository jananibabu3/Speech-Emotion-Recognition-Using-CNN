# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-Using-CNN

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the ability to detect human emotions and affective states from speech. This takes use of the fact that tone and pitch of the voice frequently reflect underlying emotion. This is also the phenomena used by animals like as dogs and horses to perceive human emotion.

Why we need it?

Emotion recognition is the part of speech recognition which is gaining more popularity and need for it increases enormously. Although there are methods to recognize emotion using machine learning techniques, this project attempts to use deep learning to recognize the emotions from data.

SER(Speech Emotion Recognition) is used in call center for classifying calls according to emotions and can be used as the performance parameter for conversational analysis thus identifying the unsatisfied customer, customer satisfaction and so on.. for helping companies improving their services

It can also be used in-car board system based on information of the mental state of the driver can be provided to the system to initiate his/her safety preventing accidents to happen
